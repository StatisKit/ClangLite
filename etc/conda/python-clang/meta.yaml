  summary: The Python interface to libclang library provides a relatively small API that exposes facilities for parsing source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST), loading already-parsed ASTs, traversing the AST, associating physical source locations with elements within the AST, and other facilities that support Clang-based development tools.

requirements:
  build:
    - python
    - python-toolchain
    - clang 4.0.1
    - zlib
    - xz                         [unix]
    - m2w64-xz                   [win]
  run:
    - python
    - clang
    - path.py
